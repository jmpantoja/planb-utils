## Methods

### clear
Removes all values from the collection.


**Line::clear**() : [Collection](../../../Collection.md)

Returns whether the collection is empty.
This should be equivalent to a count of zero, but is not required.
Implementations should define what empty means in their own context.

**Line::isEmpty**() : bool



---


### count
Returns the size of the collection.


**Line::count**() : int



---

---


### copy
Creates a shallow copy of the collection.


**Line::copy**() : [Collection](../../../Collection.md)



---


### toArray
Returns an array representation of the collection.
The format of the returned array is implementation-dependent. Some
implementations may throw an exception if an array representation
could not be created (for example when object are used as keys).

---

|Parameters: | | |

                   at that index in the sequence. If index is
                   negative, the sequence will start that far from
                   the end. |
|int |$length | If a length is given and is positive, the resulting
                   sequence will have up to that many values in it.

               will stop that many values from the end.

               If a length is not provided, the resulting sequence
               will contain all values between the index and the
