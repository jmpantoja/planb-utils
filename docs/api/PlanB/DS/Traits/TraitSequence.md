## Methods

### apply
Updates every value in the sequence by applying a callback, using the
return value as the new value.


**TraitSequence::apply**(callable $callback) : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|callable |$callback | Accepts the value, returns the new value. |

---


### contains
Determines whether the sequence contains all of zero or more values.

|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|callable |$callback | Accepts a value, returns a boolean result:

                               false: skip the value. |

---


### find
Returns the index of a given value, or null if it could not be found.

value.

---


### pop
Removes the last value in the sequence, and returns it.

|[iterable](../../../iterable.md) |$values |  |

---


### push

**TraitSequence::push**(mixed ...$values) : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|mixed |...$values |  |

---


### reduce
Iteratively reduces the sequence to a single value using a callback.


**TraitSequence::reduce**(callable $callback, mixed|null $initial = null) : mixed


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|callable |$callback | Accepts the carry and current value, and
                            returns an updated carry value. |
|mixed|null |$initial | Optional initial carry value. |

---


### remove
Removes and returns the value at a given index in the sequence.


**TraitSequence::remove**(int $index) : mixed


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|int |$index | this index to remove. |

---


### reverse
Reverses the sequence in-place.


**TraitSequence::reverse**() : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)



---


### reversed
Returns a reversed copy of the sequence.


**TraitSequence::reversed**() : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)



---


### rotate
Rotates the sequence by a given number of rotations, which is equivalent
to successive calls to 'shift' and 'push' if the number of rotations is
positive, or 'pop' and 'unshift' if negative.


**TraitSequence::rotate**(int $rotations) : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|int |$rotations | The number of rotations (can be negative). |

---


### set
Replaces the value at a given index in the sequence with a new value.


**TraitSequence::set**(int $index, mixed $value) : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|int |$index |  |
|mixed |$value |  |

---


### shift
Removes and returns the first value in the sequence.


**TraitSequence::shift**() : mixed



---


### slice
Returns a sub-sequence of a given length starting at a specified index.


**TraitSequence::slice**(int $index, int $length = null) : [Sequence](../../../Sequence.md)


|Parameters: | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|int |$index | If the index is positive, the sequence will start
                   at that index in the sequence. If index is
                   negative, the sequence will start that far from
                   the end. |
|int |$length | If a length is given and is positive, the resulting
                   sequence will have up to that many values in it.
                   If the length results in an overflow, only values
                   up to the end of the sequence will be included.</p>

<pre><code>               If a length is given and is negative, the sequence
               will stop that many values from the end.

               If a length is not provided, the resulting sequence
               will contain all values between the index and the
               end of the sequence.
</code></pre>
