## Classes

| --- | --- |
| [PlanB\DS\Vector\AbstractVector](../../PlanB/DS/Vector/AbstractVector.md) | A Vector is a sequence of values in a contiguous buffer that grows and
shrinks automatically. It’s the most efficient sequential structure because
a value’s index is a direct mapping to its index in the buffer, and the
growth factor isn't bound to a specific multiple or exponent. |
